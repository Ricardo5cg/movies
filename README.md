> This project consists of a list of 1000 movies. The user can see the full detail of each movie by opening a popup, can also filter the movies by the top 10 revenue and top 10 revenue by each year.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Observations
> Initially, I began by implementing 'lazy loading' functionality by fetching 15 movies in each instance. However, I encountered a limitation with the API as it lacked a filter to retrieve the top 10 movies based on revenue. Consequently, I ended up fetching all the movies in one go and storing the data in a useState, which was somewhat counterintuitive. Nonetheless, this approach allowed me to demonstrate my ability to implement 'lazy loading' and utilize API parameters. Additionally, I made some minor adjustments to the filters style to ensure that the 'clear icon' remained visible and wasn't obscured by the dropdown.
